# Image Pattern Recognisation in Weather Forecast 

Use less Expensive way to Forecast Weather and at the same time present good output. This is an implementation of Neural Networks and K-NN on Matlab.The model predicts Season in the given Image . 

The repository includes:

* Source code of Feature Extraction using HOG.

* Source code of implementing Neural Networks (Backpropagation).

* Source code of implementing K-NN algorithm.

* Data set of Weather Images.

* Testing .

## Getting Started

* feature_extraction.m : the directway to start .It show feature extraction from predefined dataset.

* Knn_classify.m :shows how to train and classify using k-NN algorithm.

* Neural_net.m: show the implementation of Neural Network Model for classifying the Season.

* knn_accuracy.m: Code to Show the Accuracy of model using K-NN algorithm.

* The Model achieved accuracy of 92% using Neural Networks.

* The model also shows the Accuracy difference between KNN aand Neural Network Backpropagation.
